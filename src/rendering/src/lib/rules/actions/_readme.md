Conditions in this folder will be automatically generated into `src\rendering\src\temp\ruleActionFactory.ts` upon running the Bootstrap command.

To create a rule action, copy one of the existing actions, and ensure that the class name matches the file name. 

Also ensure that the Id name matches the `{FileName}Id` format.
